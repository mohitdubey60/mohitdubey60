///DispatchGroup is used to club multiple dispatchRequests and notifiy on completion of all
///DispatchGroup can have same or different DispatchQueues grouped
///Only necessary thing is to make balanced calls to enter() and leave() on a dispatch group to have it synchronize our tasks.
///Call enter() to manually notify the group that a task has started and leave() to notify that work has been done.
///call group.wait() too which blocks the current thread until the groupâ€™s tasks have completed.
///wait(timeout:). This blocks the current thread, but after the timeout specified, continues anyway. To create a timeout object of type DispatchTime, the syntax .now() + 1 will create a timeout one second from now.
///wait(timeout:) returns an enum that can be used to determine whether the group completed, or timed out.
