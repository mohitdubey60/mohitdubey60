Gareth Southgate's men now play their final match before the World Cup, so will be doubly determined to end a five-match winless streak - England's worst such run since 2014.",

        "comment": "Following a tame first 45 minutes, the final half-hour saw the teams trade blows throughout a dramatic denouement, in which the result could easily have gone either way. England showed great character to fight back from two goals down and facing a fresh wave of criticism, while Germany were clinical up front but lacked the defensive discipline to keep their hosts at bay. Individual errors and moments of brilliance marked an entertaining conclusion to the Nations League, and both sides are soon off to the World Cup.",

The Three Lions' next chance to end that run comes in November's World Cup clash with Iran in Doha. Meanwhile, Germany will play a pre-tournament friendly against Oman before kicking off their quest for a fifth global crown versus Japan.",
