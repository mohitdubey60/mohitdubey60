That was the Blaugrana's third win on the spin, and they have scored 11 times and conceded just once in the process. Pitched into a challenging group also featuring Bayern Munich and Inter this year, Barca failed to make it through the knockout phase of last season's competition - finishing third in Group E behind Bayern and Benfica. It is now seven years since they last lifted Europe's top trophy.",

Dembele was in full flight for much of the first half, while Lewandowski has clearly lost none of his clinical edge and is already two goals in to what may be another prolific Champions League campaign. Despite making several changes to his team, Xavi has been rewarded with a lively performance, which has kept the Czech champions subordinated.",

With Pedri and Dembele irrepressible at times, and hat-trick hero Lewandowski at his lethal best, the Catalan club saw off Plzen's challenge, which was at its strongest for a brief period in the first half when they pulled to within a goal of their hosts. All in all, it's a job well done for Barca; the visitors have several more tough tasks to face in the coming weeks.",
